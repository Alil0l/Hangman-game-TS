### ☠️ **Unleash your inner wordsmith and defy the hangman's noose!** ⚔️

This isn't your average game; it's a handcrafted puzzle odyssey built from the ground up with my own two hands!  No pre-built libraries here - pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fueled the fire, with Sass and TypeScript adding elegance and power. ✨

Get ready to sharpen your wit and put your vocabulary to the test in the legendary game of Hangman! I poured my heart and soul into every line of code, and I'm thrilled to share the excitement of the chase with you. 

Building this from scratch was no small feat, so any feedback or reviews would be greatly appreciated!
